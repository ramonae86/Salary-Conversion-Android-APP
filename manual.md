# Salary Calculator
The app is a salary comparison tool that takes salary from one city as input and outputs the salary required to have an equivalent standard of living in the new city.

We support 10 cities in US, they are:
- Atlanta, GA
- Athens, GA
- New York City, NY
- Austin, TX
- Seattle, WA
- San Francisco, CA
- Washington D.C.
- Boston, MA
- Tampa, FL
- Las Vegas, NV

Each city is associated with a Cost of Living Index, we use that to convert the equivalent salary. A complete list of Cost of Living Index can be found [here](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings.jsp).

## Usage
Usage is very simple, a **positive integer** salary is required(otherwise an error message would pop out), you also need to set **two different** cities, that is, transfering from NYC to NYC is not allowed. When you click the RUN *botton*, an equivalent salary will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
